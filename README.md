# Ruby on Rails: Experimental message board

This small message board explores the possibilities of giving each user their own font and text color. I've also tried to make the message display as compact as possible.

As of July 2012 the design is still immature and many needed capabilities are missing. The app is built on Rails 3.2.0 , and is deployed at warm-castle-1012.herokuapp.com
